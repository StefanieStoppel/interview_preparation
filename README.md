# Interview preparation

This repo contains a function stub for the infamous "FizzBuzz" task and can hopefully help you
prepare for real Python coding interviews :)

I also included the `notebooks` directory with an additional `README` for an 
exploratory data analyses (EDA) task using the bike sharing data set (`data/bike_sharing.csv`).
You can check it out to practice your data analysis and visualization skills.

## Setup
1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Clone the repository locally.
3. Create the conda environment by running `conda env create --file environment.yml`.
4. Activate the conda environment: `conda activate interview_preparation`.
5. Open the repo in your preferred IDE and enjoy the exercise :)
